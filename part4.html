        <h2 id="brief">Brief Discription</h2>
        <p>The BIG BANG THEORY is two guy friends and roommates Leonard and Sheldon, 
        physicists who work at the California Institute of Technology, may be able to tell everybody more 
        than they want to know about quantum physics, but getting through most basic social situations, 
        especially ones involving women, totally baffles them. How lucky, then, that babe-alicious waitress/aspiring 
        actress Penny moves in next door. Frequently seen hanging out with Leonard and Sheldon are friends and fellow 
        Caltech scientists Wolowitz and Koothrappali. Will worlds collide? Does Einstein theorize in the woods?
